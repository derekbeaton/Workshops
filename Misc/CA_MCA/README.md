Simple & Multiple Correspondence Analyses
================

# Overview

A guest lecture on CA and MCA for PSY2002: MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL INFERENCE. Helps illustrate (1) relying on PCA can
be a crime and (2) to illustrate many of the data coding/transform
strategies and overall awesomeness of simple and multiple correspondence analysis.

“For both \[the French and Dutch data science/analysis\] schools, coding
categorical variables with the indicator matrix of dummy variables and
considering them as Gaussian, for instance, is almost a crime.”

For many more details see a different workshop:

# Slides

Slides are available in /Rmd/. An overview of the presentation is:

  - Revisit of PCA
  - Some data we’ll work with
      - And why we shouldn’t have used PCA for these data\!
  - Simple correspondence analysis
      - Highlight connections to Chi2
      - Highlight connections to canonical correlation analysis
  - Multiple correspondence analysis
      - Small example, including a criminal act of correlating
        categorical data
      - MCA of multiple categorical variables
      - Our first fuzzy friend: Ordinal data
      - Our second fuzzy friend: Continuous data  
      - MCA of continuous, categorical, and ordinal data (crime free\!)
  - Some bonus material
      - Cool analyses
      - Where to get more details on mixed data
      - Software
  - Truncated reference list
