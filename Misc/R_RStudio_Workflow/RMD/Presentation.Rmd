### Organize your project folders and markdown

* What works for you?
* What works for your organization or team?
* Maximize utility, minimize complexity


# Part 1

# Part 2: RStudio & Project setup

### RStudio

* IDE: Integrated development environment
* RStudio: Does so much
  * We scratch the surface here
* Quick walk through
  * Followed by specific set up 
  * Generally, but
  * Also for this workshop

### RStudio Setup

* Download R and Rstudio
  * Strongly recommend Microsoft R (https://mran.microsoft.com/open)
  * Comes with Intel MKL
* Plain R is fine (https://cran.r-project.org/)
  * Can relink to faster libraries 
* Download RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)  

### RStudio Environment

### Benefits of RStudio

* Built-in integration with version control (git or SVN)
* R Markdown
  * Save and execute code
  * Generate high quality reports that can be shared
  * Create presentations (like this one!)
  * Even write papers
  * This workshop
    * See https://github.com/derekbeaton/Workshops/tree/master/Misc/R_RStudio_Workflow
* Python, D3 (JavaScript), SQL, Shiny, LaTeX, Git/SVN, HTML/CSS, and so much more.


### RStudio is more

* Not just an IDE (integrated development environment)
* A company
* A community
* A conference
* A centralized resource

## Project and Environment Setup


### RStudio Setup

* See https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/r-setup.html for a detailed guide

### For safety & collaboration 

* RStudio projects
  * "RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents."
  * Allows for return to key states
* .Rproj files
  * Basically a text file with some parameters for start up

### Projects

Create a new one for:

* a folder
* packages
* (and from) git repos:

### What is Git?

SOMETHING

### Git & Projects

* Git
* Download git and link executable within RStudio 
![](../external/images/setup_1_rstudio_git.PNG){width=60%} 


### Format .gitignore

* File types to ignore via version control
* `**` before each extentions will match directories anywhere in the repo
