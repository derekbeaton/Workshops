##### So we can get data
library(opendatatoronto)
library(ckanr)

##### So we can work some magic
library(dplyr)
# or just:
library(tidyverse)
## we also need some help from another tidy package
library(magrittr)

##### So we can inspect and analyze
library(inspectdf)
library(DataExplorer)
library(summarytools)
library(ExPosition) ## disclosure: this one is mine

##### So we can make things look extra awesome
library(ggplot2)
library(factoextra)
library(gridExtra) ## we may not need this for today, but it's good to have around
library(kableExtra)
