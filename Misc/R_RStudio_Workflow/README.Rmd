This workshop is a crash course on key needs for R in data science. It comes from a much bigger version of the workshop that can be found here: https://github.com/jennyrieck/workshops/tree/master/2019_Rstudio_Magic

The presentation can be found in `RMD` under `Presentation.*` in various formats (the .pdf, the original .rmd, and the .tex generated in the process). All code examples can be found in `R`. An example of an RMarkdown report is also found in `RMD`, which calls into a script in the `R` folder.
